- Add a portable.bat to the install directory for using it from a usb disk
- Make the windows installer installable without administrator privilege
- Frequently used icons in main toolbar should not have dropdown menus
- Change some ugly xpm format toolbar icons to png format tango icons
- When prompting unsaved document, show a normal yes-or-no dialog
- Make copy and paste for unicode characters works with other programs
- Use correct fonts for simplified and traditional chinese documents
- Fix the problem when inputing fullwidth left an right double quotes
