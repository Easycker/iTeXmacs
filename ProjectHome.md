TeXmacs is a powerful software for writing scientific documents. The aim of this project is to make it more easy to use. Currently the following things have been done:

  * Make popup menu vary with current mode and show only relative items
  * Add a portable.bat to the install directory for using it from a usb disk
  * Make the windows installer installable without administrator privilege
  * Frequently used icons in main toolbar should not have dropdown menus
  * Change some ugly xpm format toolbar icons to png format tango icons
  * When prompting unsaved document, show a normal yes-or-no dialog
  * Make copy and paste for unicode characters works with other programs
  * Use correct fonts for simplified and traditional chinese documents
  * Fix the problem when inputing fullwidth left an right double quotes

I will submit all patches back to TeXmacs project, and remain some minor customizations here.
